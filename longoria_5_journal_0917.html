		<p> I didn't really understand that many things on the test, a lot of it I still don't get. I feel I did bad on the test because I missed a day the first week of school when I was in Mr.Vidol's class and they had
		    already learned how to make their first website so I missed the introduction about the tags and many other things of how to put a website together. </p>
