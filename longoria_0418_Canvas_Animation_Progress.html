            <p>I haven't really been doing well on my animation. I'm lost on what code to use or what to do. I've been searching for ideas on what to make my animation about. A few days ago I decided to make circles and make them float around the web page.</p>
            
            <p>A function in JavaScript are lines of code to do a specific task. You use the word Function, followed by a name, followed by parentheses. </p>
            
            <p>I used a lot of circles for now and thats mainly the whole function.
